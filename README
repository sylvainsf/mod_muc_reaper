Description: This ejabberd module causes all clients to reconnect when a member of the cluster goes down. This fixes inconsistant behavior in MUCs observed when an user on a surviving server is not notified that the process serving the MUC now resides on a new node.

To get full clustered behavior of MUCs all ejabberd nodes should have the same mnesia settings for the MUC tables and rooms should be persistent.
